# Transfer_learning

## The goal of this code is three-fold:

Introduction to the Transfer Learning (Part-A)
Gain experience with three dimensional input data (colored images), and pretrained models (Part-A)
Introduction to Multi-Label Classification (Part-B)

## Dataset
CelebA is a large-scale face attributes dataset with more than 200K celebrity images, each with 40 attribute annotations. The images in this dataset cover large pose variations and background clutter.

## Task for Part-A
Build a classifier with the Keras library function calls and pretrained models to classify gender in the CelebA dataset, completing the given code and without changing the network.

## Task for Part-B
In this part, you'll modify the model to generate predictions for 10 attributes iin CelebA (gender, smile etc; 10 out of 40 are selected for simplifying the task) at once (use multi-label setup) given an image from the dataset.

## Software:
Keras is a library that we will use especially for deep learning, but also with basic neural network functionality of course.
